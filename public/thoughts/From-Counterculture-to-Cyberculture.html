<p>Together, the <em>Catalog</em> and the <em>Supplement</em> became textual forums within which a geographically dispersed collection of individuals and groups could come together, in text and sometimes pictures, and recognize each other as members of a single community.

<p>On the computational metaphor (seeing everything as <a href="../thoughts/computability" class="internal alias" data-slug="thoughts/computability">computable</a>)</p>
<p>“We are compiling a vocabulary and a syntax that is able to describe in a single language all kinds of phenomenon that have escaped a common language until now. It is a new universal metaphor. It has more juice in it than previous metaphors: Freud’s dream state, Darwin’s variety, Marx’s progress, or the Age of Aquarius. And it has more power than anything else in science at the moment. In fact the computational metaphor may eclipse mathematics as a form of universal notation.”</p>
<p>“Society as a whole, as well as its constituent organizational parts, functioned much like organisms and machines.”</p>
<p>“The principles governing the world of the soft — the world of intangibles, of media, of software, and of services — will soon command the world of the hard — the world of reality, of atoms, of objects, of steel and oil, and the hard work done by the sweat of brows.” — New Rules for the New Economy</p>

<p>“[The hippie’s] arrival tapped into memories of very old patterns of colonization and migration. A chicano member of New Mexico’s Reality Construction Company commune told a visiting reporter, ‘every time a white hippie comes in a buys a Chicano’s land to escape the fuckin’ city, he sends that Chicano <em>to</em> the city to go through what he’s trying to escape <em>from</em>, can you dig it?… Then when that money’s gone, see, the Chicano has to <em>stay</em> in the city, cause now he ain’t got no land to come back to.”</p>

<p>“Brand suggests that top-down politics (i.e. the kind where Mr. Advantage tells Mr. Disadvantage what to do) is bankrupt. The center of change must be the individual, acting with other likeminded individuals. This emphasis on local action echoes the notion of the individual’s local role in maintaining universal systems.”</p>
<p>WEC seems to promote an incredibly individualistic approach; Indians must work with Indians, the Third World with the Third World, blacks with blacks, and so on. No group should count on help from any other… Such segregation might seem to conflict with the WEC’s celebration of ‘whole’ systems. This seems to be an artifact of the fact that all members of the WEC were white and relatively young, with a high level of education and easy access to social and financial resources.</p>
<p>“The great machines of empire had been miniturized and turned over to individuals, and so transformed into tools with which individuals could improve their own lives.”</p>
<p>“As a variety of economic sociologists have noted, the mid-1980s saw hierarchical firms in many industries and several nations reorganize themselves as project oriented networks. They laid off workers, broke component elements of firms into semi-independent project teams, and decentralized their management structure.”</p>
<p>“Although the hive had a queen, he pointed out it was governed by the rule-driven behaviour of its many members. In the hive one could see ‘the true democracy and all distributed governance’. One could also see the faded image of New Communalism. Leveled, collaborative, linked by invisible signals and shared feelings, Kelly’s hive was a sort of natural commune.” (more on <a href="../posts/collaborative-thinking" class="internal alias" data-slug="posts/collaborative-thinking">collaborative-thinking</a>)</p>
<p>“Together, <em>Wired</em> suggested, this digital generation would do what the New Communalists had failed to accomplish: they would tear down hierarchies, undermine the sorts of corporations and governments that had spawned them, and, in the hierarchies’ place, create a <a href="../thoughts/peer-to-peer" class="internal alias" data-slug="thoughts/peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a>, collaborative society, interlinked by invisible currents of energy and information.”</p>
<p>“The urge to ‘hack’ politics by bringing governance down to a mangeable local level and by basing social integration on technologically facilitated forms of consciousness was one of the driving impulses behind the New Communalist movement”</p>
<p>“In many industries today, and in some parts of military and academic life as well, hierarchies have been replaced by flattened structures, long-term employment by short-term, project-based contracting, and professional positions by complex, networked forms of sociability.”</p>

<p>“I always thought tools were objects, things: screw drivers, wrenches, axes, hoes. Now I realize that tools are a process: using the right-sized and shaped object in the most effective way to get a job done.”</p>
<p>On CompuServe and elsewhere, developers largely treated information as a commodity to be exchanged and users as consumers of information goods</p>
<p>“Biological life does not want to keep speeding up like a chip design, cycling ever faster year by year.”</p>
<p>“Behind the fantasy of unimpeded information flow lies the reality of millions of plastic keyboards, silicon wafers, glass-faced monitors, and endless miles of cable. All of these technologies depend on manual laborers, first to build them and later to tear them apart.”</p>
